Exercise #1: If someone gets a positive test, is it "statistically significant" at the p<0.05 level? Why or why not?

sample = 1000 people
False positive rate 5%
no false negative rate
World Health Organization estimated HIV prevalence 0.6% 

True positives = 1000 * 6/1000 = 6 people
False positives = 1000 * ((100-6)/100) *.05 = 47 people

6/(6+47) = ~11%
No, it is not statistically significant at the p<0.05 level. The accuracy of the test givent he low prevalence of HIV is ~11% accurate not 95% accurate.

Exercise #2: What is the probability that if someone gets a positive test, that person is infected?
P(Infected | Positive) = (P(Positive | Infected) * P(Infected))/P(Positive)
